# MUL_retrieval
Jupyter notebook script to get units data from http://masterunitlist.info/

Extracting and collecting information takes some time - expect 20-30 minutes of extraction.
As a result, the file unit_list_{timestamp}.csv is saved.

This file will be used later in the application with interactive AlphaStrike cards (Battletech tabletop game).
